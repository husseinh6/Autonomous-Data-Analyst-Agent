# Case study notes — running log

Notes captured as the project progresses, to feed the eventual Notion
write-up (week 6). Not the write-up itself — just raw material: what
worked, what broke, what the agent got wrong.

## 2026-08-10 — Week 1, Day 1
- Repo scaffolded, technical design signed off.
- Open decision resolved: full yelp_db stays local for dev; a trimmed
  subset gets deployed to a free-tier cloud MySQL for the public demo.
- Packages installed locally (venv), repo pushed to GitHub
  (husseinh6/Autonomous-Data-Analyst-Agent).
- Anthropic API key created, rotated once after being visible in a
  screenshot (safe practice, no actual exposure risk since caught
  immediately), saved to local .env. Monthly spend limit set (Anthropic
  doesn't offer a lifetime cap — monthly is the available mechanism).
- Day 1 (repo/packages/API key/spend cap) complete. Aiven cloud DB setup
  deliberately deferred to closer to deployment (week 6) — not needed yet.
- Next: Tue Aug 11 — Streamlit skeleton (page loads, upload button, blank
  results area), per Plan.md Week 1.
